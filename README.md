This is a simple CouchDB design doc testing tool.

Usage:

```javascript
var CouchDBTest = require('couchdb-test');
var test = new CouchappTest({
  fixture: {a: 1},
  src: 'path/to/map.js'
});
var result = test.runMap();

assert.equals(result, fixture);

```

### `require()`

CouchDB supports `require()` within design doc functions. It works slightly
different from `require()` in e.g. Node.js (in which these tests are run).
Instead of relying on CouchDB’s `require()` we will be using a couchapp
specific pre-processing directive. To make everything work, we have to
jump through a small hoop:

Say you want to `var foo = require('foo');` within a map function. Do this:

```javascript
function(doc) {
  // prepare for require
  var module = module || {};

  // This next line is a `couchapp` preprocessor line, that copy and pastes the contents
  // of `path/to/foo.js` into this function. It should define the variable `foo`.
  // That is how this code is run within CouchDB.
  // !code path/to/foo.js

  // This next line makes sure that we only run the Node.js `require()` when the
  // `!code` macro is not expanded. This is why !code path/to/foo.js should create
  // the `foo` variable. If it doesn’t exist, we run a regular Node.js `require()`.
  // With *one* caveat: since `map.js` will be run within `eval()` in another module
  // than your tests, we need to put the full module path into `require()`, otherwise,
  // the foo package would have to be a dependency of the couchdb-test package, which
  // wouldn’t work out. Anyhoo!
  var foo = foo || require(process.cwd() + '/different/path/to/foo'
}
```

### Test

`npm test`
